# VibeTTY

VibeTTY is an experimental fork of [ConnectBot](https://github.com/connectbot/connectbot), a powerful open-source SSH client for Android.

## About This Fork

VibeTTY builds upon ConnectBot's excellent foundation, adding enhancements focused on modern terminal workflows and "vibe coding" - AI-assisted development where you need a capable terminal experience on mobile devices.

### Key Features

- **Kitty Keyboard Protocol**: Full support for the [Kitty keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) enabling Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, and other modifier combinations in modern CLI tools like Claude Code
- **Virtual Terminal Width**: Render the terminal wider than the physical screen (e.g., 100+ columns on a narrow phone) with single-finger horizontal panning
- **Improved Keyboard Handling**: Better detection of connected vs. paired Bluetooth keyboards
- **Force Software Keyboard Option**: Show soft keyboard even when hardware keyboard is detected
- **Toggle Keyboard/Title Bar**: Tap the terminal to toggle UI visibility
- **Long-press Text Selection**: Works correctly with horizontal pan offset
- **Per-orientation Font Sizes**: Remember different font sizes for portrait and landscape

See [NEW_FEATURES.md](NEW_FEATURES.md) for implementation details and [docs/](docs/) for technical documentation.

## Why VibeTTY?

Traditional terminal emulators on Android were designed for basic SSH access. VibeTTY is optimized for:

- **AI-assisted coding sessions** - Full keyboard protocol support means tools like Claude Code work properly with multi-line input (Shift+Enter creates newlines, Enter submits)
- **Wide terminal content** - Many CLI tools assume 80+ columns; virtual width lets you view them properly on narrow screens
- **Modern TUI applications** - Improved scroll/pan handling for apps that produce continuous output

## Credits

VibeTTY is built on top of **ConnectBot**, created by Kenny Root and the ConnectBot contributors. We are grateful for their years of work creating such a solid SSH client foundation.
